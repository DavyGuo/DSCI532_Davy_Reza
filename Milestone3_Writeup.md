### Reflection on the feedback

After the feedback session, we received 2 feedbacks from other groups and TA's as well. These feedback are deeply appreciated by us.

During the "Fly on the wall session", both of the groups were play around focus on our 1st scenario which is the history crime record of one specific city and we were expecting them to do so. However, neither of the groups found our 2nd scenario which is displaying crime statics of several top/bottom cities of one specific year. After we showing them about this in the informed-run, we recieved positive feedback about this design. This difference make us realized that, one of the design flaw is we didn't show our app's function or features obviously and entirely. Users are supposed to easily get the app by clicking around. As we assumed, the slide bar of year mislead the users to only focus on selecting the year range. They didn't noticed or tried to explore the possibility of put the two buttons together to "activate" the second scenarioes.

(This being said, we're trying to fix this flaw by add instruction note to the slide bar, the users would be instructed to use the second function. We've been considering using ua year text boxes to let the user input their target range or specific year, but we still want to let the user only using mouse in the app. Hence, we're keeping the slide bar)

Another minor flaw brought up by other groups is that in the sorting scenarioes, when the user chose the maximum number of cities, which is 15, the x-axis is overlapped by city names so it was very hard to read. We are tilting the direction of the words so that cities can be display clearly.

Some feedback suggest that for the crime data comparsion, we should consdiering put the different crime type in one plot or using stacked bar. Our purpose is for users to view simple and clear data, while put too much data in one plot may be confused to user, especially when the number of cities increases. Hence, we will keep our straightforward display.

### Updates since Milestone 2

As mentioned earlier, we focus on improve the design of the app since milestone2.

We are glad to see that most features of our proposal has been achieved. Hence, our objective is unchanged.
