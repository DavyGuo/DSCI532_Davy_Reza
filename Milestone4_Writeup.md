### "What changes did you decide to implement given the time limit, and why do you think this is the best thing to focus on?"

Since we've achieved all the feature we proposed, we've decided to focus on the improvement of the chart.

The label of the histogram used to be vertical. we've noticed that the x-axis label will overlap if the number of cities is too much. Hence, we've rotated the direction of text to make all label clear.

### "If you were to make the app again from scratch (or some other app in general), what would you do differently?"

If we redo the app again, we will consider about removing some of the feature. Either the "sorting data" scenario or "prediction" function.

1.  For the sorting data scenario, it didn't fit perfectly with the layout of the whole app, users feedback shows that this scenario is not as straightforward as the line chart. We may give it a second thought.

2.  For the prediction part, it mainly because of the accuracy of linear regression model. The result of the prediction only shows a result while have no proof to backup the number

### "What were the greatest challenges you faced in creating the final product?"
